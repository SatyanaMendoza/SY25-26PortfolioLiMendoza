    <h2>Inazuma and It's Archon</h2>
    <p>Known as the Nation of Eternity, Inazuma is an isolated archipelago located
        in the easternmost part of Teyvat. It is ruled by the Electro Archon, the 
        Raiden Shogun, also known as Beelzebul, who governs through the Inazuma Shogunate.
        Her ideal is “Eternity,” and she seeks to preserve her nation unchanged 
        through absolute control and divine order. Guided by her ideal of “Eternity,” 
        the Raiden Shogun believes that only through stillness can Inazuma endure the passage 
        of time. The land itself reflects her will—its skies flash with lightning, and its people 
        live under strict laws that emphasize loyalty, discipline, and faith in their Archon.

    </br><h2>The History of Inazuma</h2>
    <p>
        Long ago, Inazuma was ruled by two twin gods, Makoto and Beelzebul, who were both known 
        as the Raiden Shogun. Makoto, the original Electro Archon, guided the nation with kindness 
        and sought peace and harmony. Her rule brought prosperity and stability to the islands. 
        However, after the Cataclysm 500 years ago, Makoto perished, and her twin, Beelzebul, assumed 
        her position as the sole ruler of Inazuma. Stricken by grief and the fear of loss, Beelzebul 
        turned inward, seeking to halt the changes and tragedies brought by time itself. From this 
        resolve emerged her vision of Eternity, an unchanging ideal where neither death nor decay 
        could reach her nation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, Inazuma’s openness faded. The Sakoku Decree was enacted, closing the nation’s 
        borders to outsiders, and the Vision Hunt Decree soon followed, stripping away Visions from 
        its people, symbols of their ambitions and dreams. These harsh measures were meant to 
        protect Inazuma from chaos and change but instead led to unrest and sorrow among its 
        citizens. In response, the Watatsumi Resistance, led by those who opposed the Shogunate’s 
        decrees, rose to restore freedom to the people.
