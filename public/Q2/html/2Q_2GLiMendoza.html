                <h2>Inazuma and Its Archon:</h2>
                <p>Known as the Nation of Eternity, Inazuma is an isolated archipelago located in the easternmost part of Teyvat. It is ruled by the Electro Archon, the Raiden Shogun, also known as Beelzebul, who governs through the Inazuma Shogunate. Her ideal is “Eternity,” and she seeks to preserve her nation unchanged through absolute control and divine order. Guided by her ideal of “Eternity,” the Raiden Shogun believes that only through stillness can Inazuma endure the passage of time. The land itself reflects her will—its skies flash with lightning, and its people live under strict laws that emphasize loyalty, discipline, and faith in their Archon.</p>

                <h2>Inazuma's Lore and History:</h2>
                <p>Long ago, Inazuma was ruled by two twin gods, Makoto and Beelzebul, who were both known as the Raiden Shogun. Makoto, the original Electro Archon, guided the nation with kindness and sought peace and harmony. Her rule brought prosperity and stability to the islands. However, after the Cataclysm 500 years ago, Makoto perished, and her twin, Beelzebul, assumed her position as the sole ruler of Inazuma. Stricken by grief and the fear of loss, Beelzebul turned inward, seeking to halt the changes and tragedies brought by time itself. From this resolve emerged her vision of Eternity, an unchanging ideal where neither death nor decay could reach her nation.<br><br>Over time, Inazuma’s openness faded. The Sakoku Decree was enacted, closing the nation’s borders to outsiders, and the Vision Hunt Decree soon followed, stripping away Visions from its people, symbols of their ambitions and dreams. These harsh measures were meant to protect Inazuma from chaos and change but instead led to unrest and sorrow among its citizens. In response, the Watatsumi Resistance, led by those who opposed the Shogunate’s decrees, rose to restore freedom to the people.</p>
